This guide will also cover things like common errors and how to resolve them, making sure your judging process goes as smoothly as possible. Sound good? Great! Let's begin!

## Before we begin

Using gavel at your event is cool and all but there are some prerequesites to it. You need access to the submission system your event is using, and the emails if the expo judges at your event. Alongside that, perhaps most importantly, you need a place to deploy gavel.

For your convenience we have created click-to-deploy templates to the places below:

<style>
  table {
    table-layout: fixed ;
    width: 100% ;
  }
  thead {
    width: 100%;
  }
  td {
    width: 25% ;
  }
</style>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
     <td>Azure</td>
     <td>Google Cloud</td>
     <td>Heroku</td>
     <td>AWS</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <a href="https://azuredeploy.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          <img src="https://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png"/>
        </a>
      </td>
      <td>
      <!-- [![Run on Google Cloud](https://storage.googleapis.com/cloudrun/button.svg)](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/editor?shellonly=true&cloudshell_image=gcr.io/cloudrun/button&cloudshell_git_repo=https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-run-hello.git) -->
